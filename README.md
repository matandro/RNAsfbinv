# RNAfbinv 2.0

RNAfbinv is a fragment based RNA design tool. It uses a simulated annealing process to optimize a 2D RNA structure.<br/>
The similarity is based on fragment based design. A tree alignment is done based on nodes (structural motifs).<br/>
Nodes are comparable if they are both bounded motifs (stems) or unbounded motifs (multi loop, interior loops, bulges ect...).<br/>
Each iteration the target motif tree will be aligned to the current candidate tree.<br/>
The best alignment with the addition of other valuable features will generate a design score.<br/>
Design score of 0 is exact fit but even higher scores can generate a good candidate.<br/><br/>
RNAfbinv 2.0 can be easily installed as it is available on pypi (python 3 compatible). To install it simply run ```pip install rnafbinv```.

## Attaching Vienna RNA

[Vienna RNA package](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ "Vienna RNA home") is required for RNAfbinv to work. This must be installed separately.<br/>
Current version was tested with Vienna 2.4 and above. RNAfbinv will identify Vienna package if it's bin directory is in PATH.<br/>
If you wish to link a specific installation of Vienna set the VIENNA_PATH environment variable to the correct bin directory.

You can set Vienna location in python
```python
import os
os.environ['VIENNA_PATH'] = "VIENNA_BIN_DIR_PATH"
```

or directly via the vienna script
```python
from rnafbinv import vienna
vienna.set_vienna_path("VIENNA_BIN_DIR_PATH")
```

## Usage

The design process can be ran using the following code:
```python
from rnafbinv import RNAfbinvCL
RNAfbinvCL.main(command_line_arguments)
```

To generate a tree for a specific sequence / structure:<br/>
Structure is a dot bracket notation structure and sequence is an IUPAC string with the same length
```python
from rnafbinv import shapiro_tree_aligner
shapiro_tree_aligner.get_tree(sructure, sequence)
```

To compare two trees and score them:
alignment_rules has a default value and is optional
```python
from rnafbinv import shapiro_tree_aligner
shapiro_tree_aligner.align_trees(source_tree, tree_target, alignment_rules)
```

## GUI / Command line

You can download the RNAfbinv wrapper from [RNAfbinv2.0 git repository](https://github.com/matandro/RNAsfbinv/)<br/>
The main folder includes python code to run the GUI / command line and a configuration file:
* RNAfbinv.py - A GUI wrapper for RNAfbinv2.0
* RNAfbinvCL.py - A command line wrapper for RNAfbinv2.0
* **Required** varna_generator.py - Used to generate images based on [VARNA](http://varna.lri.fr/ "VARNA rna homepage")
* **Required** config.ini - Configuration file with paths to required software (information below).

If you remove the VARNA jar or do not have java installed, images will not be generated but the design process will proceed normally.<br/><br/>

To specify [vienna package](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ "The ViennaRNA Package homepage") binary folder please update the 'VIENNA' parameter in config.ini (or set VIENNA_PATH environment variable)<br/>
To specify Java binary folder please update the 'JAVA' parameter in config.ini (or set JAVA_PATH environment variable)<br/>
To specify [VARNA](http://varna.lri.fr/ "VARNA rna homepage")'s jar file please update the 'VARNA' parameter in config.ini (or set VARNA_PATH environment variable)<br/>
Note that if the java or vienna package binaries are in your environment variables you may leave it empty.

Example to a valid config.ini file which has java installed and within the system's path:
```
[PATH]
VIENNA=~/ViennaRNA/bin/
#JAVA=
VARNA=~/VARNA/VARNAv3-93.jar
```

## Webserver

RNAfbinv2.0 can be found in a web server combined with incaRNAtion. The webserver generates starting seeds using incaRNAtion global sampling algorithm.<br/>
Te seed sequences are then sent to RNAfbinv2.0 for design. [incaRNAfbinv web server](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/incaRNAfbinv/ "incaRNAtion & RNAfbinv")
